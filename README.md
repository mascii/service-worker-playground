# Service worker playground

## Getting started

Install packages and start server:

```bash
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

And you'll access to below URLs.

- http://localhost:8080/hello_world/

### For development

For compiling worker script, we use *iframe mode* in webpack-dev-server. You could access to `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/*/` if you want to develop with hot reloading feature.
